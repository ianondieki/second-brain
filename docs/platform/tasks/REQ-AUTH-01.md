# REQ-AUTH-01

- Task: T1.5, T1.9 (`docs/platform/PLAN.md` Phase 1)
- Agent: orchestrator / impl-backend (B), impl-frontend (F), test-writer (T), security-reviewer (Fable) review
- Files owned: `bridge/auth/`, `frontend/app/(public)/`, `frontend/e2e/auth.spec.ts`
- Depends on: T1.4.

## Scope

argon2id (m=64 MiB, t=3) signup/login, magic links (single use, 15 min), server-side sessions (`httpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax`, 30 days) with signed double-submit CSRF, login throttle 5/min per IP and per account, TOTP enrol/verify with recovery codes, TOTP mandatory for org owner/admin/signatory/reviewer and staff, step-up helper (MFA within 12 h). OAuth moved to REQ-AUTH-02 (D-20). Signup/login UI, Playwright E2E (Pixel 5 at 360 px and desktop) with axe.

## Acceptance criteria and tests

AC-SEC-1/a (cross-tenant API 404); X1-1 signup/login E2E on the compose stack; unit tests in `backend/tests/unit/auth/`.

## Notes

Signup always answers 202 "check your email" (no account enumeration); the verification link signs the user in.

## Phase 2 follow-ups (from the Phase 1 report; picked up in Phase 2)

1. JS budget: send CSP and Permissions-Policy on page responses only (not on `/_next/static`), drop legacy polyfills with a modern browserslist target, and state in `docs/runbooks/dev-setup.md` and the budget test whether 150 KB means KB (1000) or KiB.
2. Local E2E: pin `workers: 1` (or a longer web-server step) for local runs so argon2 hashing in the single API process does not time out; CI unchanged.
3. Password forms: a hidden `autocomplete="username"` field so password managers save the right account.
4. `/settings/security`: hide the Password section while two-step enrolment is in progress.
5. The staff dependency (staff role + enrolled and verified TOTP; 404 for non-staff) ships with the first `/admin` route (REQ-ADM-01, T2.3/T2.6b).
Item 6 (enforced CSP, HSTS) stays in Phase 8 (REQ-SEC-03).
